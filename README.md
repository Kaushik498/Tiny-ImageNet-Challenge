# Tiny-ImageNet-Challenge

This code python & tensorflow based code to solve the Tiny ImageNet challenge. Tiny Imagenet dataset has 200 classes. Each class
has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images. <br />
Here I have used 2 convolutional layer, 1 dense layer with a dropout rate of 0.4. As the optimizer, I have used Adam optimizer 
from tensorflow library. <br />
